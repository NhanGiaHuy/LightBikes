 * LightBikes.java
 *
 * Assignment: Final Project
 * Class: Rochester Institute of Technology, ISTE-121.01, 2155
 * Professor: Michael Floeser
 *
 * This class is the main class for the LightBikes game created for our team's final project in ISTE-121. The game is
 * modeled after the TRON-esque light bikes in the movie and in the arcade. Players control a bike that leaves a
 * "wall of light" behind them as they travel across the game grid. They face an opponent who is also leaving a wall
 * of light behind them. If one player hits the wall of light, they lose and the game ends.
 *
 * This class is the main file and is executed as the game client.
 *
 * This class is responsible for the GUI
